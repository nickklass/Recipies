            Ahh. CocaCola and Ices, Typical Drink Everywhere
        </h3>
        
        <p>
           I wont allow this to take up too much time but the thing is that CocaCola is everywhere and we all love it.
           I dont know what it is about the drink and if it were only sugar, more people would just put sugar
           in a glass of water and call it. Pouring it just right is important
        </p>
       
        <p>
            The small glass bottle of CocaCola from the shop and some ice cubes can change your life.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Ingredients
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>CocaCola. (froma supermarket)</li>
            <li>A glass to hold it. (Preferably 'Rocks')</li>
            <li>ice cubes from the freezer</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Instructions
        </h3>
        <p>
            Make sure you are ready
        <p>
            Place the ice in the glass. If you do not have ice, refer to the ingredients and make sure you have
            everyhing you need. This is important.
        <p>
            As you pour and moke make sure the bubbles dont overflow, be grateful for the pleasure you will soon experience.
            The thing is, without the ice bouncing on you top lip, the flow would not be the same. Also, as you set down your drink,
            there is a small layer of water from the ice cube that settles on top of the CocaCola. Enjoy as you pass it and 
            get to the sweet bubbling juice inside. Make sure you close your bottle well and set it upright on the door of the fridge.
