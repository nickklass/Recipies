# Recipies
Where I Share My Favourite Foods From Around The World

I am currently taking part in a free coding program where I will be learning some programming over the next few months and hopefully some time to come. I don't know what started me on this course but I am enjoying it so far. 

I have been given a task where I have to use the new knowledge I have to create a recipe webpage.
With what I learned in the past days, I should be able to do it with no problem.
Here are some of the skills I will be practicing
* Git workflow
* CL exploring
* HomePage, AboutPage, Html Basics.(Inages,links,headings)

After, I will be using this page to practice CSS. Instead of following what the webpage is telling me what to do exactly, I have decided to go ahead and create a real webpage for myself.s
